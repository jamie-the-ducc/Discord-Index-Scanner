**Discord Index Scanner** scans Discord's `index.js` files for any signs of malicious code injection, as it is a commomn method for token grabbers and Discord malware. A lot of people aren't aware of this issue or are unable to check, so this script will do it for you!

#### What is index.js injection?
Index.js injection is when a hacker injects malicious code into your Discord client. Every time you open the client, the hacker's code will be ran on your PC - usually consisting of token grabbers, password grabber, IP loggers, and the like.
