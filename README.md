**Discord Index Scanner** scans Discord's `index.js` files for any signs of malicious code injection, as it's a main method for token grabbers and Discord malware, which a lot of people are unaware of or are unable to check. This script will do it for you!

### What is index.js injection?
Index.js injection is when a hacker injects malicious code into your Discord client. Every time you open the client, the hacker's code will be ran on your PC - usually consisting of token grabbers, password grabber, IP loggers, and the like.

## DOESN'T WORK WITH DISCORD-PTB FOR SOME REASON
